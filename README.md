# Piccolino: Arduino Compatible + WIFI + OLED + SRAM + SD CARD

2026-02-22 Using the current verision of the Arduino IDE, I installed the the Atmel-AVR Xplained mini board "package" (see https://github.com/AtmelUniversityFrance/atmel-avr-xmini-boardmanagermodule/) and selected. Atmel atmega328p Xplained mini. This got the sketch to upload.
